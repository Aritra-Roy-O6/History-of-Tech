The 19th century saw the birth of mechanical computation, a revolutionary idea driven by visionaries who imagined machines that could think with numbers. This was the age of intricate clockwork and grand, unrealized designs.</p></div></div>
                    <div class="panel panel-2"><img src="./images/babagge.png" alt="Charles Babbage"><div class="panel-content"><h3>The Visionary: Charles Babbage</h3><p>Charles Babbage, an English mathematician and inventor, is considered "the father of the computer." Frustrated by human errors in mathematical tables, he designed the Difference Engine and later the far more ambitious Analytical Engineâ€”a general-purpose computer that was never fully built in his lifetime.</p></div></div>
                    <div class="panel panel-3"><img src="./images/babaggeEngine.png" alt="Analytical Engine"><div class="panel-content"><h3>The Analytical Engine</h3><p>This design was a masterpiece of mechanical engineering. It featured an Arithmetic Logic Unit ("the Mill"), conditional branching, loops, and integrated memory ("the Store"). It was to be programmed with punched cards, an idea borrowed from the Jacquard loom. Its concepts are the very foundation upon which digital computers were built a century later.</p></div></div>
